#[doc = "AES Crypto Length 0 (LSW) These registers are used to write the Length values to the EIP-120t. While processing, the length values decrement to 0. If both lengths are 0, the data stream is finished and a new context is requested. For basic AES modes (ECB, CBC, and CTR), a crypto length of 0 can be written if multiple streams need to be processed with the same key. Writing 0 length results in continued data requests until a new context is written. For the other modes (CBC-MAC, GCM, and CCM) no (new) data requests are done if the length decrements to or equals 0. It is advised to write a new length per packet. If the length registers decrement to 0, no new data is processed until a new context or length value is written. When writing a new mode without writing the length registers, the length register values from the previous context is reused.\n\nYou can [`read`](crate::generic::Reg::read) this register and get [`aesdatalen0::R`](R).
