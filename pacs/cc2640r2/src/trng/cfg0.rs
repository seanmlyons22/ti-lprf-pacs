This field determines the minimum number of samples (between 2^6 and 2^14) taken to re-generate entropy from the FROs after reading out a 64 bits random number. If the value of this field is zero, the number of samples is fixed to the value determined by the MAX_REFILL_CYCLES field, otherwise the minimum number of samples equals the written value times 64 (which can be up to 2^14). To ensure same entropy in all generated random numbers the value 0 should be used. Then MAX_REFILL_CYCLES controls the minimum refill interval. The number of samples defined here cannot be higher than the number defined by the 'max_refill_cycles' field (i.e. that field takes precedence). No random value will be created if min refill > max refill. This field can only be modified while CTL.TRNG_EN = 0. 0x00: Minimum samples = MAX_REFILL_CYCLES (all numbers have same entropy) 0x01: 1*2^6 samples 0x02: 2*2^6 samples ... 0xFF: 255*2^6 samples"]
